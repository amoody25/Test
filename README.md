I am a student at UNCC studying computer science. My goals are to graduate with my Bachelors degree and make my way into the workforce and start a career. Once I have experience in the computer science field I will migrate into computer security and cybersecurity. Currently I am investing most of my time in work, school, and studying for certification exams like CompTIA A+ and more!
